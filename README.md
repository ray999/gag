# Dog World (狗狗世界)

This project is a Roblox game named "Dog World", developed with assistance from an AI.

Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

## About The Game

Dog World is a pet simulation game where players can adopt, collect, and care for a variety of dogs. The game features multiple ways to acquire new pets, an in-game currency system, and interactive quests.

### Core Features

- **Pet Adoption:** Adopt dogs through different methods:
  - **Snack Machine:** An automatic machine that attracts stray dogs every 10 seconds.
  - **Adoption Center:** A center that restocks with 10 new dogs every 25 minutes, available for purchase with DogCoins.
  - **Premium Shop:** A special shop to purchase limited edition dogs with Robux.
- **Economy System:**
  - **DogCoins:** The primary in-game currency. Players automatically receive 500 DogCoins every 3 minutes.
  - **Robux:** Used for purchasing exclusive, limited-edition dogs.
- **Dog Requests:** Your dogs will occasionally have requests (e.g., playing, eating). Fulfilling these requests rewards you with DogCoins.

## Current Status

All core gameplay features have been implemented. The next step is to replace the placeholder building and dog models with higher-quality assets from the Roblox Creator Marketplace.

### Recent Fixes

- Fixed the `CFrame` property in `src/buildings/AdoptionCenter.rbxmx` by expanding it into explicit rotation and position fields, resolving malformed XML that prevented `rojo serve` from running.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "gag_gpt5.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `gag_gpt5.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
