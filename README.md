# Dog World (狗狗世界)

This project is a Roblox game named "Dog World", developed with assistance from an AI.

## About The Game

Dog World is a pet simulation game where players can adopt, collect, and care for a variety of dogs. The game features multiple ways to acquire new pets, an in-game currency system, and interactive quests.

### Core Features

- **Pet Adoption:** Adopt dogs through different methods:
  - **Snack Machine:** An automatic machine that attracts stray dogs every 10 seconds. *(Unique ID: 1ac654213aa2686d08a84957000039b7)*
  - **Adoption Center:** A center that restocks with 10 new dogs every minute (testing) available for purchase with DogCoins. *(UI Unique ID: 1ac654213aa2686d08a849570000224d)*
  - **Premium Shop:** A special shop to purchase limited edition dogs with Robux.
- **Stray Dogs:** Various stray dogs wander the world and can be found roaming around.
- **Dog Models:** Every dog receives a runtime-generated unique ID and uses its `HumanoidRootPart` as the model's `PrimaryPart`, enabling behavior scripts to track and move it accurately.
- **Economy System:**
  - **DogCoins:** The primary in-game currency. Players automatically receive 500 DogCoins every minute (testing).
  - **Robux:** Used for purchasing exclusive, limited-edition dogs.
  - **Wallet Display:** The player's current DogCoin balance is always visible on screen. *(Unique ID: 1ac654213aa2686d08a8495700003bcb)*
- **Dog Requests:** Your dogs will occasionally have requests (e.g., playing, eating). Fulfilling these requests rewards you with DogCoins. During testing, these occur every 30–60 seconds.

## Current Status

All core gameplay features have been implemented. The next step is to replace the placeholder building and dog models with higher-quality assets from the Roblox Creator Marketplace.

### Recent Fixes

- Reordered the `CFrame` elements in `src/buildings/AdoptionCenter.rbxmx` so that position fields precede rotation components, resolving the malformed XML error that prevented `rojo serve` from running.
- Added roaming stray dogs and expanded the list of available breeds.
- Shortened in-game timers to one minute for faster testing.
- Tagged the adoption UI, pet snack machine, DogCoin wallet, and dog models with unique IDs for asset tracking.
- Added an asset loader to retrieve UI components from the asset library by their unique IDs.
- Reworked the asset loader to load IDs on the server with `InsertService` or on the client via `require`, eliminating `GetObjects` permission errors.
- Updated client scripts to return a value so they can be required without runtime failures.
- Corrected `DogModelManager` to use `OnServerEvent` instead of `OnClientEvent`, resolving the server-side event error.
- Fixed building component positions by assigning explicit CFrames, preventing structures from spawning below the ground level.
- Renamed bootstrap scripts so server and client modules load correctly at runtime, resolving missing `PlayerManager` and `CoinDisplay` errors.
- Ensured each dog model generates a unique ID and uses `HumanoidRootPart` as its `PrimaryPart` so movement scripts can track them.

### Building Models

- Ensure every building model has its `PrimaryPart` set (usually to the main `Body` part). Scripts rely on this to position models with `SetPrimaryPartCFrame`.

### Dog Model Requirements

- Every dog model is created with a unique `uniqueID` attribute generated via `HttpService:GenerateGUID`.
- The model's `HumanoidRootPart` must be set as its `PrimaryPart` so behavior scripts can track and move the dog reliably.

### Client Remotes and UI Assets

- Client scripts retrieve remote events and functions by requiring `ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Remotes`.
- UI components are loaded through `ReplicatedStorage.Shared.AssetLoader`, for example:
  ```lua
  local AssetLoader = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.AssetLoader)
  local gui = AssetLoader.loadGui("<assetId>", playerGui)
  ```

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "gag_gpt5.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `gag_gpt5.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
